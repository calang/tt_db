Edit the Makefile at the root of this git repository
to ensure there is a target called "install_db"
whose purpose is to install PostgreSQL in the current node

- Use the apt-get package manager
- call the installation script using a single sudo command from the Makefile
- Create auxiliary installation bash script in the scripts folder, called install_postgres.sh
- use the lines in the config/bash_prologue file as prefix to the contents of install_postgres.sh, replacing _module_name_ with postgres
