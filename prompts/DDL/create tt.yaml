Produce a timetable data base spec YAML file, similar to tt-sample.yaml,
following the spec in db_spec_schema.yaml
which corresponds to a sqlite data base
that can be used to store the rows represented
by the Prolog predicates in timetable_base.pl,
creating one table to store the values corresponding to each of the predicates.
Store the data base spec in a file called tt.yaml in the specs folder.
