Acting as a System Archtect,
notice that the current project
is developed in Linux and is meant to run on a Linux Ubuntu server,
contains Prolog code, meant to handle rule-based inference using clpfd,
contains Python code to handle other aspects, like overall data handling and management
and uses a SQLlite single-file data base.

How do you recommend to integrate this app modules so that
- once complete it can be conveniently deployed as a web app in a centralized server
- communication across different modules, writen in either Python, Prolog or Bash scripts
is both efficient in its execution and easy to manage, from a software management perspective?

Consider alternatives like
- multi-process Linux pipe communication
- microservice-based deployment, based on a set of http services
- any other that happens to be a current popular method to integrate Python and SWI-Prolog modules.

Provide an analysis of different integration options, with comparative pros and cons.
