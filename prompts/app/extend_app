Extend this Python Dash application to include
several tabs, where each tab contains a page allowing
CRUD operations on a different table in the database described
by the tt.sql script.
There should be one tab for each of the tables in tt.sql.
The application should use the same layout as the example application.

In addition, the tabs corresponding to tables that have any foreign key
for the foreign key fields, should show a drop-down list of values
from the referred table.  These tabs should also have a button
allowing the navigation to the tab corresponding to the referred table.
