Now, create a Python script that will produce a sqlite script
which will create a sqlite DB with the structure described in tt.yaml
where the tt.yaml is just an example of a db spec file,
following the schema described in db_spec_schema.yaml.
The Python script must be able to create any data base
defined in a spec YAML conforming to the schema in db_spec_schema.yaml.

Adjust the resulting Python script
by removing references to Dict, List and using dict, list instead
and replacing any lines with spaces only to empty lines.
